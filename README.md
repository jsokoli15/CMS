This project conforms with a simple application which is a Web-Based and consists as a simplifier management system for doctor visits .  One of the main usage of our project is to leave an appointment online and keep track of  records for each patient in a online form for a period of time and stored and connected to your health card instead of actual use , on paper.

In order to finish the idea we need to cowork with actual city clinics  so we can't miss any detail. Family doctors will be able to leave appointmens for their patients to forward medication if their state is more serios , for example to the 'Specialist Doctor' or even 'the hospital'. They will be able to leave notes for each patient and their medical recors or their specific details.

Appointments can be cancelt by the patiens through the email with a automated response . An display of his timetable will we offered besides the one of Hospitals' doctors or Specialist doctor which he uses to book his patients visits or further treatment.

All this data can be also accesed for urgent cases because his personal and medical datas are displayed there . We intend to wipe of queue so the public can have simpler ,faster and better healthcare .
